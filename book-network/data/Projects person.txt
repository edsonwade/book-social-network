Creating a project as a junior Java developer with one year of experience is a great way to demonstrate your skills and gain valuable experience. Here's a project idea that incorporates the technologies you mentioned: Mockito, Spring Security, Spring Boot, JPA, API documentation, Docker, and CI/CD.

**Project Idea: Online Bookstore Application**

**Description:**
Build an online bookstore application where users can browse, search for, and purchase books. The application should have features like user authentication, a catalog of books, shopping cart, and order management.

**Technologies and Components:**

1. **Spring Boot:** Use Spring Boot to create the backend of your application. It simplifies the development of RESTful APIs.

2. **Spring Security:** Implement user authentication and authorization using Spring Security. You can have roles for customers and administrators. Customers can browse, search, and make purchases, while administrators have control over book inventory and orders.

3. **Spring Data JPA:** Utilize JPA to interact with a relational database to store information about books, users, and orders.

4. **Mockito:** Write unit tests using Mockito to ensure the correctness of your code. Test different layers of your application, including controllers, services, and repositories.

5. **API Documentation:** Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or Spring RestDocs. This will help other developers understand how to interact with your API.

6. **Docker:** Containerize your application using Docker. This will make it easy to deploy and manage your application in various environments.

7. **CI/CD:** Set up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. You can use Jenkins, Travis CI, or any other CI/CD tool of your choice. The pipeline should automatically build and deploy your application whenever you push changes to your version control system (e.g., Git).

**Additional Features:**

1. **User Profiles:** Allow users to create profiles, save their favorite books, and track their order history.

2. **Search Functionality:** Implement a search feature to allow users to search for books by title, author, or genre.

3. **Shopping Cart:** Users should be able to add and remove books from their shopping cart, review the cart, and complete the purchase.

4. **Payment Integration:** Integrate a payment gateway to handle online payments for book purchases.

5. **Order Management:** Implement an order management system for administrators to track and manage book orders.

6. **Security Enhancements:** Implement security best practices such as input validation, password hashing, and secure session management.

By working on this project, you will gain practical experience with a wide range of technologies commonly used in the industry. You can showcase your project on platforms like GitHub and include it in your portfolio when applying for jobs, demonstrating your ability to design and develop a full-fledged application.





If you want to focus on the backend part of the project, you can still create a meaningful project that showcases your skills in Java, Spring Boot, and related technologies. Here's a project idea for the backend part of an online bookstore application:

**Project Idea: Backend API for an Online Bookstore**

**Description:**
Build a RESTful backend API for an online bookstore. This API will handle book catalog management, user authentication, and order processing. The front-end part can be developed separately or can be simulated using tools like Postman.

**Technologies and Components:**

1. **Spring Boot:** Use Spring Boot to create the backend API, as it simplifies the development of RESTful services.

2. **Spring Security:** Implement user authentication and authorization using Spring Security. You can have roles for customers and administrators.

3. **Spring Data JPA:** Utilize JPA for interacting with a relational database to store information about books, users, and orders.

4. **Mockito:** Write unit tests using Mockito to ensure the correctness of your code. Test different layers of your application, including controllers, services, and repositories.

5. **API Documentation:** Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or Spring RestDocs to help other developers understand how to interact with your API.

6. **Docker:** Containerize your API using Docker. This will make it easy to deploy and manage your API in various environments.

7. **CI/CD:** Set up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automatically build and deploy your API whenever you push changes to your version control system (e.g., Git).

**API Endpoints:**
Design a set of RESTful API endpoints to manage the following functionalities:

1. Book Catalog Management: Create, retrieve, update, and delete books.

2. User Authentication: Register users, handle login/logout, and manage user profiles.

3. Shopping Cart: Allow users to add and remove books from their shopping cart.

4. Order Processing: Process book orders, including payment integration (or simulate it).

**Security Enhancements:**
Implement security best practices such as input validation, password hashing, and secure session management.

By focusing on the backend part of this project, you will have a fully functional RESTful API that demonstrates your ability to design and develop robust and secure backend systems. You can showcase the code, tests, and API documentation in your portfolio to showcase your skills to potential employers.


In your backend application for an online bookstore, you will need to define several entities, their attributes, and their data relationships to represent the core components of your system. Here are some of the key entities, their attributes, and data relationships:

1. **Book Entity:**
   - Attributes:
     - `id` (unique identifier)
     - `title`
     - `author`
     - `description`
     - `price`
     - `ISBN` (International Standard Book Number)
   - Relationships:
     - Many-to-Many with `User` for user favorites
     - One-to-Many with `OrderItem` for book orders

2. **User Entity:**
   - Attributes:
     - `id` (unique identifier)
     - `username`
     - `password` (hashed)
     - `email`
   - Relationships:
     - Many-to-Many with `Book` for favorite books
     - One-to-Many with `Order` for user orders

3. **Order Entity:**
   - Attributes:
     - `id` (unique identifier)
     - `orderDate`
     - `status` (e.g., "Pending," "Shipped," "Delivered")
   - Relationships:
     - Many-to-One with `User` for the customer
     - One-to-Many with `OrderItem` for items in the order

4. **OrderItem Entity:**
   - Attributes:
     - `id` (unique identifier)
     - `quantity`
     - `subtotal` (price x quantity)
   - Relationships:
     - Many-to-One with `Order` for the order to which it belongs
     - Many-to-One with `Book` for the book in the order item

These entities and their relationships should provide the basis for managing books, users, user orders, and items within those orders. You can extend or modify these entities based on the specific requirements of your project. Additionally, you'll need to create corresponding database tables and configure the JPA relationships in your Spring Boot application to reflect these data structures.

Remember to set up proper foreign key relationships and cascading operations in JPA to maintain data integrity and make it easier to work with these entities in
 your application.
