Certainly! Let's describe the Sequence Diagram and Use Case Diagram for the "Online Task Management System" project and provide an example for each.

### Sequence Diagram:

**Description:**
A Sequence Diagram visualizes the interactions and sequence of messages exchanged between different objects and components in a system. In the context of your "Online Task Management System," we can create a Sequence Diagram to illustrate how a user creates a task.

**Example Sequence Diagram:**
In this example, we'll create a Sequence Diagram for the "Create Task" use case. The diagram shows the interaction between a user and the application's `TaskController` and `TaskService`.

+------------------+           +------------------+           +------------------+
|   User           |           |   TaskController  |           |   TaskService   |

       |    new task with details |                              |
       |-------------------------->|                              |
       |                           |                              |
       |                           |                              |
       |                           |                              |
       | 2. Acknowledge request   |                              |
       |    processing            |                              |

       |                           |                              |
       |                           |                              |
       |                           |                              |
       |                           | 3. Call to create task       |
       |                           |----------------------------->|
       |                           |                              |
       |                           |                              |
       |                           |                              |
       |                           |                              |
       |                           |                              |
       |                           |                              |
       |                           | 4. Acknowledge task creation  |
       |                           |    success                   |
       |                           |<-----------------------------|
       |                           |                              |
       |                           |                              |
       |                           |                              |
```

In this Sequence Diagram, the user initiates the process by requesting the creation of a new task. The request is handled by the `TaskController`, which in turn communicates with the `TaskService` to create the task. Once the task is successfully created, an acknowledgment is sent back to the user.

### Use Case Diagram:

**Description:**
A Use Case Diagram provides a high-level view of a system's functionalities and interactions with external actors. It describes the various use cases the system supports and how external actors interact with it.

**Example Use Case Diagram:**
In this example, we'll create a Use Case Diagram for the "Online Task Management System" to represent the main use cases and interactions.

      |   |
      |   |
      |   | ------- (5) Mark Task as Complete
      |   |
      |   |
      |   | ------- (6) Log Out
      |   |

+-------------------+
|  Online Task      |
|  Management System|
+-------------------+
```

In this Use Case Diagram:

1. **User** interacts with the "Online Task Management System" to perform various use cases:
   - (1) Log In
   - (2) Create Task
   - (3) Update Task
   - (4) View Task List
   - (5) Mark Task as Complete
   - (6) Log Out

The Use Case Diagram provides an overview of the system's functionalities and how users interact with it. This can be a starting point for further elaboration of use cases and their associated scenarios.
