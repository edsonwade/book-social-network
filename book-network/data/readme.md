## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:


## Setup
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Configure your database connection in `application.properties`.
3. Build the project using Maven or your preferred build tool.
4. Run the application using `java -jar` or by using an integrated development environment.

For more detailed setup instructions, refer to the [Setup Guide](setup.md).

## API Endpoints
The project provides the following API endpoints for task management:

- `/api/tasks` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- `/api/users` (GET, POST)
- `/api/users/{id}` (GET, PUT, DELETE)

For a complete list of endpoints and their descriptions, refer to the [API Documentation](api.md).

## Database Schema
The database schema includes two main tables: `User` and `Task`. Users can create and manage their tasks, and tasks are associated with their respective owners.

For a detailed database schema, refer to the [Database Schema](database.md).

## Security
The project uses Spring Security to secure user authentication and authorization. Passwords are securely hashed before storage.

## Testing
Unit tests are implemented using JUnit and Mockito to ensure the reliability of critical components in the application.

## Deployment
The project can be deployed using Docker, and a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is set up for automated deployment.
