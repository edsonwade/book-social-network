**Project Idea: Online Task Management System**

**Description:**
Create a web-based task management system that allows
users to create, update, and manage their tasks.
 Users can sign up, log in, and have personalized task lists.
 This project will involve user authentication, task management, and RESTful API development.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Users can register with their email and password.
   - Users can log in and log out securely.
   - Implement password hashing for user security.

2. **Task Management:**
   - Users can create, update, and delete tasks.
   - Each task should have a title, description, priority, and due date.
   - Users can mark tasks as completed or pending.
   - Users can filter and sort tasks based on priority, due date, and completion status.

3. **User Profile:**
   - Users can view and edit their profiles, including a username, email, and a profile picture (optional).

4. **RESTful API:**
   - Create RESTful APIs to support the frontend application.
   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.
   - Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each API endpoint.

5. **Database Integration:**
   - Utilize a relational database (e.g., MySQL or H2) to store user profiles and task data.
   - Define database entities and relationships for users and tasks.

6. **Security:**
   - Implement Spring Security to secure the application and API endpoints.
   - Authenticate and authorize users to access their tasks and profile.

7. **API Documentation:**
   - Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger to make it easier for other developers to use your API.

8. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for critical components of your application, ensuring its reliability.

9. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku) to make it accessible online.

10. **CI/CD:**
    - Set up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the build and deployment process.

By working on this project, you'll demonstrate your ability to create a secure and functional web application using Java and Spring Boot. You can showcase your project on platforms like GitHub and include it in your portfolio to impress potential employers.


In the online task management system project using Java and Spring Boot, you'll need to define several entities to represent the core data structures of your application. Here are the main entities:

1. **User Entity:**
   - Attributes:
     - `id` (unique identifier)
     - `username`
     - `email`
     - `password` (hashed)
     - `profilePicture` (optional)
   - Relationships:
     - One-to-Many with `Task` for tasks owned by the user

2. **Task Entity:**
   - Attributes:
     - `id` (unique identifier)
     - `title`
     - `description`
     - `priority` (e.g., low, medium, high)
     - `dueDate`
     - `completed` (boolean to indicate task completion status)
   - Relationships:
     - Many-to-One with `User` to associate tasks with their owners (users)

These two entities form the core of your task management system. Users can create, update, and manage their tasks, and each task is associated with a specific user. You can expand or modify these entities based on the specific requirements of your project. Additionally, you'll need to create corresponding database tables and configure the JPA relationships in your Spring Boot application to reflect these data structures.
